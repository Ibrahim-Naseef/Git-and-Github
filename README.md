- `git clone [url]`: Clones a repository from a remote server to your local machine.
- `git add [file]`: Adds a file or changes in a file to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "[message]"`: Commits staged changes with a descriptive message.
- `git push`: Pushes committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository.
- `git pull`: Fetches changes from a remote repository and merges them into the current branch.
- `git branch`: Lists all branches in the repository.
- `git merge [branch]`: Merges changes from a specified branch into the current branch.

### Additional Git Commands

#### Repository Management

- `git status`: Displays the status of the working directory and staging area.
- `git log`: Shows a history of commits.
- `git diff [file]`: Shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
- `git remote add [name] [url]`: Adds a remote repository reference.
- `git remote -v`: Lists all remote repositories along with their URLs.
- `git fetch [remote]`: Fetches changes from a remote repository without merging.
- `git rm [file]`: Removes a file from the working directory and staging area.

#### Branching and Merging

- `git checkout [branch]`: Switches to a different branch.
- `git branch [branch]`: Creates a new branch.
- `git merge [branch]`: Merges changes from a specified branch into the current branch.
- `git branch -d [branch]`: Deletes a branch.
